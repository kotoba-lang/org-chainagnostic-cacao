(ns cacao.edge.verify
  "CAIP-122 / SIWE (EIP-4361) CACAO verify for the edge — CLJS port of
  cacao.core/verify (orgs/kotoba-lang/cacao). Verify-only: this Function
  never mints a CACAO, only checks one a client presents. Ed25519 signature
  verification runs on the platform's native Web Crypto (js/crypto.subtle)
  rather than a hand-rolled curve implementation — the only ported pieces
  are the wire format (base58btc, definite-length CBOR, SIWE
  reconstruction), which have no Web Crypto equivalent. CLJS-only.

  Crypto-valid does not mean valid forever: a signature never expires on
  its own, so temporal-error (mirroring kotobase.cacao.cljc's
  validate-cacao — same tolerances: 300s future-iat skew, exp enforced when
  present, 7-day max-age fallback when absent, and cloud-itonami.auth's JVM
  mirror of the same logic) is applied after crypto verify succeeds. A
  captured-and-replayed CACAO past its window is rejected here even though
  the signature itself still checks out."

  the FINAL joined text, not the array's element boundaries, so a resource
  string containing an embedded \"\\n- \" sequence reconstructs to
  byte-identical signed bytes as if it had been split into two separate
  array elements at that point. A tampered CACAO envelope (same real
  signature, `p.resources` re-encoded with two legitimate elements merged
  into one containing that embedded sequence) would otherwise pass
  signature verification with a `payload.resources` shape that was never
