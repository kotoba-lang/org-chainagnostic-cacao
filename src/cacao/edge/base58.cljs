(ns cacao.edge.base58
  "base58btc (Bitcoin alphabet) decode+encode for edge did:key parsing and
  minting.

  CLJS-only (like cloud-itonami.local-app: js/ interop throughout, no JVM
  branch — this runs in the Cloudflare Workers isolate, not the JVM).
  Decodes/encodes via the standard multiply-by-58-with-carry byte algorithm
  rather than porting ed25519.core/b58-decode's BigInteger approach, since
  ClojureScript has no arbitrary-precision integer in cljs.core and the
  byte algorithm needs none — every intermediate value stays under 256*58.

  `encode` was originally a test-only helper (cloud-itonami.edge.wire-
  fixtures, built to construct signed CACAO fixtures for cacao_test.cljc)
  and is promoted here verbatim for cacao.edge.verify-mint's did:key
  minting path (ADR pending — WebAuthn passkey -> server-held Ed25519
  did:key -> CACAO bridge). cacao_test.cljc's round-trip only ever calls
  wire-fixtures' own separate hand-written copy of this algorithm, never
  this production `encode` — the two happened to be textually identical at
  the time of the port, but nothing keeps them in sync, so that round-trip
  does NOT cover this function. base58_test.cljc's own
  `round-trips-through-production-encode` is what actually exercises this
  `encode` directly (decode(encode(bytes)) = bytes, same shapes wire-
  fixtures' copy is tested against)."
