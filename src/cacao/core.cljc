;; cacao.core — CAIP-122 / SIWE (EIP-4361) CACAO mint + verify, pure Clojure.
;;
;; A CACAO is a self-sovereign, signed, expiring capability: a SIWE plaintext
;; carrying an issuer DID, an audience, a nonce/expiry, and a `resources` grant,
;; serialized as definite-length CBOR ({h,p,s}) and signed with Ed25519. Used as
;; the no-server-key authorization for kotoba/kotobase (datom:transact leashes,
;; `kotobase:pin`, …) — minted in the holder's OWN runtime, presented as an opaque
;; `cacao_b64`, never a platform-held key.
;;
;; This packages the format that was hand-rolled inline (the ibuki/kaname leash
;; issuer, the kotobase pin client): one `mint` + one `verify`, built on
;; com-junkawasaki/ed25519-clj (sign/derive) + com-junkawasaki/dag-cbor-clj
;; (order-preserving CBOR — the p-field order is signature-significant).

;; The apex (net-kotobase clj-edge, cutover 2026-07-08) accepts a NARROWER
;; shape than a generic CACAO, and every one of its rejections is the same
;; opaque `{"ok":false,"error":"Unauthorized"}`. That opacity is why this
;; profile exists here rather than in each caller: three separate copies of a
;; hand-rolled mint drifted from it, and `kagi push`/`pull` were dead against
;; the live apex for as long as kagi carried one (ADR-2607275000).
;;
;; The rules, each read from `kotobase.edge-cacao/validate-cacao`:
;;
;;   1. `kotoba://can/kotobase:pin` must be among the resources.
;;   2. A `kotoba://graph/` scope must be present and EQUAL THE ISSUER DID.
;;      A graph-CID scope is rejected; the request body still names the CID.
;;   3. `iat`/`exp` must match ^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}Z$ —
;;      `parse-utc-seconds` accepts NOTHING else. Not epoch seconds, not a
;;      fractional part.
;;   4. The envelope header is "caip122".
;;   5. A fresh nonce per request; the edge records them for replay protection.

;; ── nonce-replay protection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
;;
;; SECURITY FIX: `verify`/`verify-chain` mint/embed a `nonce` (see `mint`,
;; `siwe-message`) but, until this addition, NEVER checked it against
;; anything — a valid, unexpired CACAO captured anywhere (logs, network
;; transit, a compromised intermediate) could be replayed verbatim any
;; number of times until its `exp`. The old Rust implementation of this same
;; trust boundary had a sharded NonceStore for exactly this (see
;; kotoba-lang/kotoba CLAUDE.md: "NonceStore: RwLock<HashMap> → DashMap", a
;; 64-way sharded in-memory nonce table with a bounded MAX_NONCES and
;; expiry-driven eviction); that protection was lost when the Rust code was
;; retired in favor of this Clojure reimplementation, which never replaced
;; it. This closes that gap.
;;
;; This is a LIBRARY, not a service: callers range from a one-shot CLI
;; invocation (`kotoba run --cacao`) to a long-running server. So the store
;; is caller-pluggable — `NonceStore` is a two-line protocol, not a
;; hardcoded implementation — and this library only owns the check/record
;; CONTRACT, never where (if anywhere) it's persisted. A plain Clojure atom
;; satisfies the protocol out of the box (in-memory, single-process); a host
;; wanting cross-process / cross-restart protection extends the protocol
;; on its own durable type (Redis, a DB row with a UNIQUE constraint, …) and
;; passes an instance of it via the `:nonce-store` opt.
;;
;; The key checked/recorded is always the 2-vector `[iss nonce]`, never the
;; bare nonce string: a nonce is only meaningful scoped to the issuer that
;; chose it (mint doesn't coordinate nonces across issuers), so two
;; DIFFERENT issuers coincidentally minting with the same nonce string is
;; not a replay and must not collide in the store.

     true  — REPLAY-KEY was fresh (not seen before) and is now recorded;

                      recorded when the CACAO is otherwise fully valid (sig

                      to pre-emptively burn a nonce that hasn't really been

   chain that share an `[iss nonce]` are caught too, not only replay across
   separate verify-chain calls. Only checked for a link whose own signature
   already verified (`(:valid? (links i))`) AND whose temporal bounds are
   satisfied at NOW (`temporal-ok?`, same iat<=now<exp rule
   `temporal-problems` enforces): an unsigned/tampered link's `nonce` field
   isn't authentic (nonce lives inside the signed SIWE plaintext) and must
   not be allowed to burn a real one — see `verify`'s own :nonce-store
   gating for the same rationale. The temporal half of this gate matters
   because `links` (built by `verify-chain` via a bare, no-`:now` `verify`
   call per link) only reflects SIGNATURE validity, never temporal
   validity — without checking `temporal-ok?` here too, a validly-signed
   but not-yet-valid or already-expired link would still burn its nonce
   against the real STORE (even though the overall chain is correctly
   rejected via `temporal-problems`), permanently locking out the
   legitimate holder from ever presenting that same chain again once it
   actually becomes valid."

(defn verify-chain
  "Verify an ordered CACAO delegation chain (root first, leaf last), given as a
   vector of base64 CACAO strings. Chain validity requires:

   - every link's EdDSA signature verifies (see `verify`);
   - for each parent→child pair the child is re-issued by the parent's
     delegate: child `iss` == parent payload `aud`;
   - the child's `resources` are a subset of the parent's under `covers?`
     (exact string match, or a parent trailing-`*` wildcard);
   - child `exp` <= parent `exp` when both are present;
   - no link's `[iss nonce]` has been seen before, per `:nonce-store` (see
     below) — a replayed link rejects the whole chain.

   OPTS may carry:

     `:now`          an ISO-8601 instant string; when given, every link must
                      satisfy iat <= now < exp (each bound enforced when the
                      field is present), so expired or not-yet-valid links
                      reject the chain.

     `:nonce-store`  a NonceStore (see that protocol + `fresh-nonce-store`
                      in this ns) checked/recorded for every link's
                      `[iss nonce]`. When OMITTED, a FRESH throwaway store
                      is synthesized for JUST this call: it still catches
                      two links of the SAME chain sharing an iss+nonce, but
                      — being discarded when the call returns — provides NO
                      protection against the same chain (or a link from it)
                      being presented again in a LATER verify-chain call.
                      Pass a store you retain across calls for that; see
                      the CACAO README's nonce-replay section. (This is the
                      same fresh-per-call fallback `verify` uses, and the
                      same caveat applies.)
