;; Compile `kotoba/siwe/window.kotoba` and run the COMPILED artifact.
;;
;; The JVM suite drives the guest through the KIR interpreter, which is not
;; the thing that ships. This runs the `.wasm` the public CLI produces, on
;; real `WebAssembly`, through amu's own `runtime/browser-host.mjs`, and
;; prints what it answered so `window_artifact_test.clj` can hold it against the
;; interpreter.
;;
;; nbb rather than a `.mjs`: this workspace does not add raw JavaScript
;; harnesses (CLAUDE.md, runtime priority).
;;
;; Some of this guest's exports take a `:document`, which is why it is here
;; and not in the shorter probe the string-only guests use: a document
;; argument has to be built by the HOST, through the runtime's own
;; `typedValues.document`, in the tagged form the KIR value plane uses
;; (`["map" [[["keyword" ":k"] v] ...]]`). Building it any other way is
;; refused as a forged value, which is the point of the seam.
;;
;; Fuel is spent over the life of an INSTANCE, not per call, so every call
;; gets a fresh one -- the same thing amu's own `runtime/dom-driver.mjs`
;; does per interaction.
