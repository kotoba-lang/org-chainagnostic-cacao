;; `kotoba/siwe/window.kotoba` -- the EIP-4361 validity window.
;;
;; ## Two oracles, because the decision has two halves
;;
;; The arithmetic half is checked against `java.time`, which is neither
;; side's invention: `instant-seconds` must agree with
;; `OffsetDateTime/parse` on every instant, including the offsets, the
;; fraction, and February 29th of a century year.
;;
;; The policy half has no portable oracle, and that is the finding. The
;; temporal rules live in `siwe.edge`, which is `.cljs` and also carries
;; secp256k1 and Keccak. `the-portable-half-has-no-temporal-check` shows
;; what a JVM or nbb caller of `siwe.core` actually gets: a message whose
;; Expiration Time precedes its Issued At parses `{:ok? true}` and binds
;; with `:problem nil`.
;;
;; So the edge's rules are TRANSCRIBED into this file -- verbatim from
;; `siwe.edge/temporal-problem` as measured on `cd98347`, quoted above the
;; function -- and driven alongside the guest. That makes the difference
;; something the suite executes rather than something a comment claims. It
;; is test scaffolding, like `->doc`; the library did not grow a second
;; copy (ADR-2608261100).
;;
;; ## What the transcription and the guest disagree about
;;
;; `a-window-that-never-opens-verifies-under-the-edge-rules`. Not Before at
;; or after Expiration Time describes an interval containing no instant.
;; `temporal-problem` compares each bound to the clock and the expiration to
;; the issuance, but never the two bounds to each other, and the skew
;; tolerance forgives `clock-skew-sec` at each end -- so there is a band,
;; two minutes wide by default, in which such a message is accepted. The
;; test puts the clock in that band and shows nil from the transcription
;; against `:window-never-opens` from the guest.
